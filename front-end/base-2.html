                        <p> Welcome to my little corner of the internet! This site is home to my latest project, Matcher AI, along with a bit about me, my work, and how to get in touch.</p>
                        <p> So, what’s Matcher AI all about? It’s a simple tool I whipped up to see how well job descriptions match my skills. You paste a job description, and it gives you a percentage score on how likely I am to be a good fit. It’s no-nonsense and honest—if the role says “must bake cakes,” and I’m not a baker (even though I make a mean banana bread), Matcher AI will let you know.</p>
                        <p> While you’re here, feel free to wander around. Check out my CV page for more on my experience and even download a copy if you’re curious. And if you’ve got thoughts, questions, or feedback—especially about Matcher AI—head over to the Contact page and drop me a line.</p>
                        <p> Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you enjoy the site!</p>
                        <h2 class="page-title">About Me</h2>
                        <p> I am an experienced  full-stack engineer with a heavy focus on infrastructure, automation, and process optimisation. Having worked on rebuilding the infrastructure from scratch for a number of companies, migration of legacy systems to the cloud, and multi-account architecture adoption to further scale and secure systems, my specialty is to optimise software development and infrastructure management for innovative efficiency.</p>
                        <p> Outside of work, I am deeply passionate about technology and automation. My home reflects this drive, featuring a custom smart hub that controls lighting, climate, and appliances, along with a self-hosted cloud infrastructure that keeps my family’s data, photos, and videos seamlessly synced and accessible. Currently, I’m building my own LLMs while continuing to refine my automation projects. Though Bash scripting remains an invaluable tool for handling complex workflows, I’ve increasingly relied on Python for its versatility.</p>

                                    <p>At Totem, my primary responsibility is to the infrastructure hosted in AWS,
                                        streamlining the deployment pipelines and reducing costs. I have recently been
                                        appointed to guiding departments in AI integration and exploring LLMs within the
                                        application. On arrival I was tasked to analyse the existing infrastructure as
                                        code (IaC), primarily written in Terraform/Open Tofu with some serverless
                                        components. The analysis phase was brief, as it quickly became clear that a
                                        complete rewrite was necessary. I designed a new deployment approach and rewrote
                                        all the IaC, leveraging Spacelift to create highly reusable modules. This was
                                        essential, as the application structure required a multi-repo project. The
                                        result is a cost-effective system that supports the deployment of various
                                        compute services across multiple environments, fully configurable and
                                        documented. During this process, it made sense to automate many existing
                                        processes and write documentation for several repositories, covering code
                                        structure, local development, dependencies, development workflow, and process.

                                    <h4>DEVOPS ENGINEER (OCT 2022 - NOV 2023)</h4>
                                    
                                    <p>As a DevOps Engineer at Togather, I played a crucial role in enhancing our
                                        deployment processes. I successfully implemented, updated, and managed
                                        streamlined pipelines, significantly improving the efficiency of our deployment
                                        procedures. This initiative resulted in a noticeable increase in operational
                                        efficiency and overall productivity.
                                        During my first few months dealing with outages was key, as Togather’s platform
                                        was not stable. Being able to jump into the underlying Linux based systems and
                                        fix issues kept Togather’s customers trading. I have spoke to customers who were
                                        directly effected by these issues, the work I did to improve and fix these
                                        issues directly relating to there success. Being able to fix the issues as they
                                        came was important but also implementing a robust patching schedule to reduce
                                        any risk to a security related incidents and keep downtime to a minimum was key.
                                        I have spoke to customers who were directly effected by these issues, the work I
                                        did to improve and fix these issues directly relating to there success.
                                        I also spearheaded the adoption of infrastructure as code using Terraform. I
                                        wanted the dev teams to be able to create, modify and experiment with services.
                                        To achieve this I created a modular structure that allowed developers to define
                                        infrastructure by updating a simple configuration file. Terraform would be able
                                        to take this configuration and build out the necessary services and
                                        dependencies. They could be spun up and destroyed as and when needed.
                                        The introduction of Control Tower under my guidance facilitated the separation
                                        of production and development environments, fostering more focused and
                                        controlled development efforts. Automating key processes allowed us to redirect
                                        resources to more strategic initiatives, giving us a competitive edge.
                                        The expansion of our monitoring framework further solidified operational
                                        stability, guaranteeing uninterrupted service delivery.I also needed to ensure
                                        that Togather had a way to recover if a disaster was to strike. I lead the
                                        initiative to make sure there services were robust, highly available and backed
                                        up regularly. I also laid the ground work for moving towards a multi cloud set
                                        up so that Changing the teams attitudes towards monitoring, testing and
                                        documentation was key and also translated into tangible business advantages,
                                        significantly contributing to the success of Togather.</p>

                                    <h4>DEVOPS ENGINEER (NOV 2018 - OCT 2022)</h4>
                                    
                                    <p>As a DevOps Engineer, I was responsible for creating, maintaining, and improving
                                        pipelines, mostly in Jenkins and Bitbucket. Ensuring our sites are secure and
                                        stable, currently, our average downtime is less than 1%. I also made sure to
                                        have as much of our infrastructure in code as possible, primarily in
                                        CloudFormation and Terraform with a heavy reliance on Docker. I have tried to
                                        automate as many manual tasks as possible using Bash, Python, JavaScript, and
                                        some Go. This has freed up day-to-day time to allow me to focus on larger
                                        projects, for example, a separation of dev and prod environments and building a
                                        monitoring solution, without any negative impact on other teams. For Jenkins, I
                                        updated our Java extensions to carry out various tasks automatically and make
                                        them work with other applications. I designed its structure, wrote code for
                                        different parts of the system, tested them, built CI/CD pipelines for the
                                        delivery process, kept versions under control, and fixed bugs. In order to
                                        produce better results, we had to consider safety, increase optimization, and
                                        enable expansion through collecting valuable information. I was responsible for
                                        setting up, securing, and scaling the Java application on Amazon EC2 instances.
                                        All this wouldn't be possible without strong relationships between myself and
                                        the teams around me. I strive to improve our system and process while
                                        coordinating with all parts of the business, from tech leads, architects, and
                                        developers to ad technicians, product, and sales teams.</p>

                                    <p>My biggest project was to migrated Drupal 7 architecture to Docker & AWS involving writing CloudFormation
                                        scripts, docker files, groovy pipelines, and shell scripts. Maintained and
                                        extended legacy PHP systems until the replacement ReactJS app hosted in Amazon
                                        S3 was started. I worked on pipelines and build scripts along with Lambda and
                                        ReactJS to control the functionality and user experience. Developed headless

                                    <p>During my time in this role, I focused heavily on product-driven features, ensuring that every update and enhancement met user needs and business goals. I was responsible for updating and maintaining six different sites, working across technologies like PHP, JavaScript, jQuery, Drupal, CSS, MySQL, and Bash. One of the highlights was building custom Drupal modules, tailoring functionality to suit each project perfectly. It was a dynamic and challenging role that honed both my technical skills and my ability to deliver impactful solutions.</p>

                                    <p>As a traffic manager, I was responsible for coordinating and managing advertising campaigns to ensure everything ran smoothly and efficiently. A big part of the role involved overseeing ad submissions, where I implemented automation to streamline the process and save valuable time. I also managed all tracking spreadsheets, designing intricate formulas and automation to handle large amounts of data with precision. This ensured that every campaign was tracked accurately, providing clear insights into performance and progress. The role demanded attention to detail, excellent organizational skills, and a knack for finding ways to make processes more efficient, all of which I enjoyed tackling head-on.<p>

                                    <p>When I was a freelance games and tools programmer, I worked on a variety of exciting and challenging projects. One of my key contributions was supporting the development of a first-person World War II FPS, where I collaborated on gameplay mechanics and optimization. I also designed and began developing an activity-tracking device for the NHS, a project aimed at promoting health and wellness, though it unfortunately ended due to funding constraints. Alongside these, I worked on several other projects, each presenting unique technical challenges and opportunities to innovate. These experiences allowed me to hone my problem-solving skills and adaptability while pursuing creative and impactful solutions.<p></p>

                                    <p>As the Program Director, I was responsible for organizing and automating the activity sign-up process, ensuring that campers were assigned to their preferred activities efficiently. I managed a wide range of camp activities, from outdoor adventures to creative workshops, creating engaging and safe experiences for the children. In addition to activity coordination, I supervised over 30 adults, conducting performance reviews and ensuring a positive and productive work environment. Safety was a top priority, and I oversaw high-risk activities like the high ropes course and swimming pools to make sure all safety protocols were followed. I also served as the emergency coordinator, ready to respond to emergencies such as earthquakes, storms, or intruders. The camp hosted kids aged 8-16, with some weeks including campers as young as 6 or as old as 18, which required flexibility in programming and leadership.</p>
